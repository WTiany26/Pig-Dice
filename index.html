      <p>Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":</p>
      <li>
        <ul>If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.</ul>
        <ul>If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.</ul>
        <ul>If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.</ul>
